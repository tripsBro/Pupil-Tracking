# Pupil-Tracking
This repository is to organize and share my project on Eye Pupil Tracking using openCV Python. 
Pupil tracking is the most common challenge for a beginner in computer Vision. I have stumbled upon the idea a lot myself and came up with a neat algorithm to track pupil. 
This code has been tested on some videos upto now but all of them had clear magnified eyes in frame.
The purpose of using eye close-up as the basis of pupil tracking was because this project is mainly focused on use on VR Headset.
